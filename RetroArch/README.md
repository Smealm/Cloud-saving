Ensure RetroArch is installed to `C:\RetroArch-Win64` as this guide is made with the assumption that this is the case.

Open Ludusavi from your Ludusavi folder in your cloud saved location
Click on 'Custom Games'
Click 'Add Game' and name it 'RetroArch'
Create 6 paths
Fill in each path with the following directories (one directory per path).

```
C:\RetroArch-Win64\states
C:\RetroArch-Win64\saves
C:\RetroArch-Win64\playlists
C:\RetroArch-Win64\config
C:\RetroArch-Win64\Retroarch.cfg
C:\RetroArch-Win64\Retroarch.cfg.bkp
C:\RetroArch-Win64\system
```

You're Done! Add RetroArch to Playnite and enjoy!
