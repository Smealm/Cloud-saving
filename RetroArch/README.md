Ensure RetroArch is installed to `C:\RetroArch-Win64` as this guide is made with the assumption that this is the case.

Open Ludusavi from your RetroArch folder in your cloud saved location
Click on 'Custom Games'
Click 'Add Game' and name it 'Flashpoint'
Create 2 paths
Fill in each path with the following directories (one directory per path), make sure you replace the windows username with the windows username you are using.

```
C:\RetroArch-Win64\states
C:\RetroArch-Win64\saves
```

You're Done! Add RetroArch to Playnite and enjoy!
