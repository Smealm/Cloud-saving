It doesn't matter where Ryujinx is installed, as long as its installation directory doesn't have a folder called `Portable` in it.

Open Ludusavi from your Ludusavi folder in your cloud saved location
Click on 'Custom Games'
Click 'Add Game' and name it 'Ryujinx'
Create 4 paths
Fill in each path with the following directories (one directory per path). Replace `_Your_Windows_Username_` with your windows username.

```
C:\Users\_Your_Windows_Username_\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\bis\user\save
C:\Users\_Your_Windows_Username_\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\profiles
C:\Users\_Your_Windows_Username_\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\config.json
C:\Users\_Your_Windows_Username_\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\system\profiles.json
```

You're Done! Add Ryujinx to Playnite and enjoy!
